The dataset used here has been downloaded from CITES (www.cites.org). This project briefly explores a few patterns in the legal trade of wildlife and presents three plots. The first plot explores the types of traded parts and informs that 'live' animals are traded most frequently. The second plot indicates that animals of the family Aves (birds) are most frequently traded. The third plot indicates that of the birds, Amazonian parrots are the top traded commodity.
